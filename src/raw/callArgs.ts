// ParachainSystem.set_validation_data is the relay-parent inherent every single
// block carries, and its decoded args are almost entirely the relay-chain storage
// proof: data.relayChainState.trieNodes measured 95.4% of the payload at block 2M,
// 97.6% at 10M and 96.9% at 13.3M, growing to ~95 KiB per block. That one call name
// is therefore 98.5-99.9% of every byte in raw_calls.args_json (474 GiB
// uncompressed, 31 GiB compressed) and, identically, of raw_extrinsics.call_args_json.
//
// The proof exists so a relay-chain validator can re-execute the candidate. It says
// nothing about Basilisk that is not already indexed, no consumer in this
// repository reads it, and everything an explorer can render about the inherent —
// the relay parent header, the DMP/HRMP messages, the relay parent descendants, the
// collator peer id — lives in the other 3-5%. Storing it also made every unrelated
// read of raw_calls more expensive: a call_name predicate does not prune granules,
// so args_json was decompressed for every row of every granule a query touched.
//
// The proof is replaced rather than deleted, so a reader sees an explicit omission
// with the node count instead of having to guess whether the block carried a proof
// at all. This mirrors the args_omitted marker balance.ts writes for oversized
// account lists.

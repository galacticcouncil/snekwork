// How often a raw_block_snapshots row is written.
//
// Today: every block. The payload is a full re-serialization of pool + registry
// state, and it is the largest table in the database, with most blocks reusing the
// previous pool state unchanged.
//
// RAW_SNAPSHOT_EVERY_N_BLOCKS is the lever that holds that volume flat: keep one
// snapshot per N blocks and the table's growth divides by N. It defaults to 1
// (today's behaviour, no change) because it is NOT free — see the coupling note on
// `assertSnapshotEveryNBlocks` below.
//
// The constraint the lever must respect: materialized views in
// clickhouse/schema/003_materialized_views.sql sample the pool state at
// `block_height % 600 = 0`
// (`grep -n 'block_height % 600' clickhouse/schema/003_materialized_views.sql`;
// deliberately not cited by line, because line numbers in that file move and this
// comment exists to be read at the NEXT cadence change). Those MVs fire on the
// snapshot row's insertion, so a grid height with no row is a permanently missing
// sample. Only divisors of 600 are therefore allowed, which is checked at startup
// rather than discovered as a hole in a pool-history chart months later.

// reaches the UI as the chain's own AccountVote wording — 'Aye'/'Nay' for a Standard
// vote, the variant name for the others ('Split', 'SplitAbstain'), 'Vote' when no side
// could be decoded — and every surface that shows one goes through here, so the badge,
// the bubble hover cards, the vote detail header and the filter chips cannot drift apart
// or leak a raw enum name.
//
// Sides are written in caps and terse. SPLIT and SPLIT ABSTAIN stay apart because they
// are not the same vote: a Split backs aye and nay, a SplitAbstain also parks capital on
// neither side, and most of the SplitAbstain votes indexed are abstain-only — collapsing
// them to SPLIT would read as if they had taken sides.

// once — it is a motion, and the hash is not an index — so a subject with no
// referendum pallet reads as the motion it is. The off-chain title, when one is
// known, always wins: it is what the vote was actually about.

// Shared by the referendum bubble chart's tag bubbles and the tag votes tab's
// grouped rows, so one vote can never read two different averages.

// runtime enum — `Locked6x`, and `None` for the no-lock case — which reads as
// neither a multiplier nor, in the `None` case, as a value at all: it looks
// like missing data next to the votes that show one. Conviction is defined in
// tenths on-chain (None = 0.1x … 6x), so the no-lock vote genuinely carries
// 0.1x of its capital, and saying so keeps it in the same vocabulary the

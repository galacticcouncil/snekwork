// to get this wrong: the chart placeholder was 168px against a 309px card, and on
// a phone — where every table row becomes a stacked card of one labelled line per
// column — the table placeholder collapsed to a single ~60px bar against a ~203px
// card. Both are measured here against the real thing in the same page load.

// Hold the API long enough to observe the placeholders, then let the fixture
// answer. The matcher is anchored at the origin root for the same reason as the
// fixture's: a loose `**/api/**` also catches Vite's `/src/api/*` modules.

// reserved 260px against a card measuring 328px at 1440 and 378px at 390, and the
// asset price card reserved 336px — right at 1440, 52px short at 390. Both are now
// built out of the loaded card's own chrome, so the heights are compared directly
// here instead of against numbers this test would have to keep in sync.
//
// The placeholder reserves a head of four performance figures, because that is the
// shape live data almost always takes (24H/1W/1M/1Y). It cannot know in advance
// that a series is too short or too spiky for `performancePoints` to offer every
// window — in this fixture the portfolio card resolves to none and the price card
// to three, and at 390px a three-figure row still fits one line where four wrap.
// So the invariant asserted always is that the placeholder is never SHORTER than
// the card, which is the direction that dropped content under the reader; the
// exact match is asserted whenever the loaded head does carry the four it drew.

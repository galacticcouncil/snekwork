// Republish decision shared by the three account-value snapshot generations
// (per-account locks, account values, LP claims).
//
// Each of them publishes the same way: insert an immutable generation under a
// fresh `snapshot_id` partition, verify it round-trips, flip the `…_state`
// pointer, drop the superseded partition. Running that unconditionally on every
// cycle rewrites byte-identical data whenever nothing changed on chain, and —
// worse than the write cost — it advances the pointer's `computed_at`, which is
// what the persisted account-directory and tag snapshots compare themselves
// against. A no-op republish therefore discards read models that were still
// exactly right.
//
// So: hash the generation about to be written and compare it to the checksum
// the pointer already carries. Equal means the pointed-at generation is the one
// we would have written, and the whole cycle can be skipped.
//
// Two things make that safe:
//  - The checksum must cover every column a reader can observe. Each caller
//    hashes exactly the fields it inserts, in a deterministic row order, so
//    "equal checksum" means "identical published rows". A checksum over the
//    SOURCES of a generation would not do: it can miss state that changes the
//    published values (see the LP claim builder, whose output depends on
//    pool state that no position row carries).
//  - The partition the pointer names must still exist with the row count the
//    pointer claims. That is read from part metadata, so it costs nothing, and
//    it turns "the partition vanished underneath us" into a republish instead
//    of a silently empty read model.
//
// The age floor is the backstop for the one failure neither check can see: a
// checksum that stopped covering a field someone added to the insert. It bounds
// how long such a bug could serve stale data, and it re-establishes the
// generation from scratch periodically without any marker state.

// Ten minutes. It is the freshness the account directory already declares for
// its own persisted snapshots (ACCOUNT_DIRECTORY_SNAPSHOT_MAX_AGE_SECONDS), so
// a skipped generation can never outlive the tolerance its main consumer
// already accepts. Against the 60s lock refresh that is a floor of one forced
// republish every 10 cycles (144/day instead of 1440); against the 300s
// value refreshes, one every 2 cycles.

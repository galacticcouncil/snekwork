// One home for "how long is a Basilisk block".
//
// Three different numbers hide behind that question and they are NOT
// interchangeable:
//
//  1. The RELAY block time — Kusama's solid 6s. The relay is not part of
//     Basilisk's block-time migration, so anything anchored on relay heights
//     (vesting schedules, `ParachainSystem.LastRelayChainBlockNumber`
//     extrapolation) keeps the hard 6000 in `NOMINAL_RELAY_BLOCK_MS` and must
//     never be routed through the parachain pace.
//  2. The parachain's NOMINAL block interval, `MILLISECS_PER_BLOCK` in the
//     runtime — 12000 until spec ~123, 6000 until spec 134, 2000 since. Every
//     runtime block-count constant is DERIVED from it — `DAYS`, the treasury
//     spend period, conviction lock periods — so it is the right slope for
//     turning one of those block counts into a duration. It is NOT
//     `aura.slotDuration`: spec 134 decoupled the author slot (which stays 6000)
//     from the block interval, so that constant reads 6000 on both sides of the
//     switch. See `runtimeParaBlockMs` for the two wall-clock-premised constants
//     that do track it.
//  3. The parachain's MEASURED pace, which runs a little behind the nominal
//     slot: ~2.1–2.3s per block against a 2000ms nominal as of Aug 2026. It is
//     the right number for "how many blocks did the chain actually produce in
//     the last N hours".
//
// (2) is read from runtime metadata when the node is reachable
// (runtimeConstants.ts — an in-memory property read on the pending layer's
// connection) and only INFERRED from indexed blocks when it is not. The
// inference is deliberately conservative, because a wrong nominal is worse than
// a stale one: it multiplies block counts up to ~400k, so adopting the wrong
// rung doubles every projected unlock date and rewrites the whole lock
// snapshot. See resolveParaBlockTime for the three guards that make inference
// safe — a two-rung ladder, a wall-clock-anchored sample, and a refusal to MOVE
// on an out-of-band measurement.

// step function that changes exactly once, at a runtime upgrade, instead of
// tracking throughput noise.
//
// The retired 12s era (pre-spec-123) is deliberately NOT a rung. The chain

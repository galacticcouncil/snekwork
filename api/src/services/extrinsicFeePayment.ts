// Which asset a transaction fee was actually charged in.
//
// `pallet-transaction-multi-payment` lets an account nominate any accepted
// currency as its fee currency. The fee is still
// COMPUTED in BSX — `TransactionPayment.TransactionFeePaid.actualFee`, mirrored
// into `raw_extrinsics.fee` (which excludes the tip) — but what leaves the
// account is that figure converted at the block's oracle price and debited in
// the nominated asset. Roughly a fifth of fee-paying extrinsics settle in
// something other than BSX (KSM, USDT, DAI, …), so the BSX number
// names an asset that never moved.
//
// The debited asset and amount live only in the extrinsic's own events:
//
//   Tokens.Withdrawn  {currencyId, who: payer}     pre-dispatch debit
//   Tokens.Deposited  {currencyId, who: payer}     post-dispatch refund
//   Tokens.Deposited  {currencyId, who: treasury}  the fee, INCLUDING the tip
//
// BSX uses the `Balances.Withdraw`/`Balances.Deposit` pair instead.
// `Currencies.Withdrawn`/`Currencies.Deposited` are duplicate mirrors of the
// orml-tokens events and must never be counted.
//
// So the fee is the treasury deposit — but an extrinsic can hold treasury
// deposits that are not fees (dust from a killed account arrives the same way,
// and a swap leg in the same extrinsic can deposit one too). Two conditions pin
// the right one:
//
//   * its currency was also DEBITED from the fee payer in the same extrinsic —
//     which is what separates a fee from a dust sweep or a pool fee leg, and
//   * it is the LAST such deposit, because `correct_and_deposit_fee` runs in
//     post-dispatch, after every event the call itself produced.
//
// The two conditions were derived on the forked codebase's chain, against
// extrinsics covering each shape: a non-native fee, a native fee arriving beside
// unrelated dust, and several deposits in one extrinsic. They hold on any runtime
// with this pallet, since they are properties of `correct_and_deposit_fee`'s
// ordering rather than of one chain's asset set.

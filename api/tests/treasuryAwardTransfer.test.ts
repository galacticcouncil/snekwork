// period, unsigned. The transfer read model only understood the three transfer events,
// so a payout was invisible on every surface that reads it: the beneficiary's activity
// feed showed the account's later trades but never the funds arriving.
//
// This is a SECOND materialized view onto the same destination table rather than a
// widening of account_transfer_activity_mv. Two reasons: the existing MV is never
// dropped, so live ingestion cannot lose transfer rows during the deploy (a drop and
// recreate leaves a gap for every block landing in between, which is silent data loss
// rather than downtime); and `Treasury.Awarded` shares none of the other events' field
// names, so folding it in would mean branching all four extractions on event_name.
// price_data.daily_chain_identity_counts_v2 is fanned into by two MVs for the same
// reason — one per source table, each with its own extraction.

// the assumption that a dated window is historical and therefore stable. A window
// whose upper bound reaches TODAY is not: blocks keep landing inside it. Under a
// constant tag the page then freezes for the cache's whole TTL (30s), and a reader
// that only moves forward — the notification evaluator's per-kind cursor — steps
// past every row that arrived meanwhile and never looks again.

// Measured live 2026-08-20: the large-trade lane went 17h and 22 qualifying trades
// without a single match while its cursor tracked the head, because day-bounding its
// fetch flipped it onto the 'tw' tag. Driving the same window with a cold cache
// matched every one of them.

// The global feed's bound is per category because the cost is, and it is the depth
// each category was measured to actually answer — a bound above that advertises
// pages the feed then refuses. At offset 2500, with and without the page's default
// $10 floor: trade 0.3/0.8s, mm 1.5/1.8s, liquidity 1.2/4.7s, transfer 1.9/6.6s,
// xcm 3.3/8.1s, all 10.0/9.9s; at 5000 the merged and trade feeds refuse because
// their candidate windows widen past the ceiling. The deep set is the categories the
// feed pages in SQL over one small source (vote_activity 121,092 rows,
// staking_activity 192,060, otc_activity 4,473), where a deep offset cannot explode:
// at offset 190,000, vote 0.11s, staking 1.26s, otc 0.19s. That is what withheld
// /activity?tab=vote&page=490 — 92% of the vote feed, at 51ms a page.

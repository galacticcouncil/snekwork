// row is that owner's EVM-side pot, falling back to the account itself. The fallback used
// to be `coalesce(b.owner, ...)`, which only works while `bind`'s owner column is
// Nullable: a LEFT JOIN fills unmatched rows with the column's DEFAULT, so reading the
// owner out of raw_account_aliases (Nullable(String)) it arrived as NULL and coalesce fell
// through, but out of account_alias_directory (plain String) it arrived as '' and coalesce
// returned the empty owner. Every unbound account then collapsed into one ''-keyed group:
// the directory went from 114,045 rows to 3,217, topped by a $135M row holding every HDX
// on the chain, and `/account/` for an empty address.
